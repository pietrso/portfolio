### ["Estimating NDVI from SAR Images Using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10282916)
**Abstract:**
The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), an indicator of vegetation health, is derived from the visible and near-infrared light reflected by vegetation, which can be measured with multi-spectral sensors. However, clouds can often obstruct land areas, making it challenging to obtain NDVI maps of the surface. This study explores the possibility of estimating NDVI from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images using a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN). Results encourage using a cGAN to address the task and provide valuable insights for future improvements.

### Sentiment Analysis on Tweets
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/pietrso/sent-analysis-transf)

**Description:**
The scope of this project is to understand how to use the Hugging Face library at a deeper level with a custom dataset. The task is a Sentiment Analysis on Airline Tweets using a DistilBert Transformer. The model has been Fine-Tuned on the dataset and the strong imbalance of the data has been tackled modifying the class weights in the loss function.

### Pedestrian Detection
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/pietrso/pedestrian-recog)

**Description:**
Academic project whose task was to train a RetinaNET model to perform object detection. The assignment requested to put more focus on deploying the model and on tuning its hyper-parameters, rather than facing the problems of the data (e.g. the strong imbalance of the dataset).

### The Creativity of Neural Networks
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/pietrso/creativity-of-nns)

[Exam discussion on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvdsyn5k2bQ&t=2s)

**Description:**
The learning procedure (the weight update) of NNs mimics the human behavior. Is creativity still exclusively a human trait, or are Neural Networks capable of demonstrating creative abilities? This project aims at exploring the possible answers to this question with the use of algorithms of Style Transfer, that is, a technique for recomposing images in the style of other images.

### Encoding and Clustering of Paintings

**Description:**
A Deep Clustering model consists of a Convolutional Autoencoder in which a specific Clustering Layer is attached to the output of the Encoder. The model iteratively groups the features with a standard clustering algorithm, K-Means, and uses the group assignments as supervision to update the weights of the network. This kind of model was used in this project trying to group a dataset of paintings according to their style/genre.
